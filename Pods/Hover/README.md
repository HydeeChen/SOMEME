# üéà What's Hover?

> **Hover** *(/Ààh…ív.…ôr/)*, *verb*
>
> "to stay in one place in the air"

Hover is a draggable **floating action button** (FAB) inspired by Apple's session [**Designing Fluid Interfaces**](https://developer.apple.com/wwdc18/803) & Nathan Gitter's [fluid-interfaces](https://github.com/nathangitter/fluid-interfaces). Hover will always stick to the nearest corner to avoid blocking content and allows the user to send it to any other corner with a single swipe.

# üì¶ Installation

## CocoaPods
Add the following line to your `podfile`:

```swift
pod 'Hover'
```
And then run the following command in terminal:

```swift
pod install
```

## Carthage
Add the following line to your `cartfile`:

```swift
github "pedrommcarrasco/Hover"
```

And then run the following command in terminal:

```swift
carthage update
```

## Swift Package Manager

To include Hover into a Swift Package Manager package, add it to the `dependencies` attribute defined in your `Package.swift` file. For example:
```
    dependencies: [
        .package(url: "https://github.com/pedrommcarrasco/Hover.git", from: <version>),
    ]
```

# ‚å®Ô∏è Usage Example
After installing **Hover**, you should start by importing the framework:

```swift
import Hover
```

Once imported, you can start using **Hover** like follows:

```swift
// Create Hover's Configuration (all parameters have defaults)
let configuration = HoverConfiguration(image: UIImage(named: "add"), color: .gradient(top: .blue, bottom: .cyan))

// Create the items to display
let items = [
    HoverItem(title: "Drop it Anywhere", image: UIImage(named: "anywhere")) { print("Tapped 'Drop it anywhere'") },
    HoverItem(title: "Gesture Driven", image: UIImage(named: "gesture")) { print("Tapped 'Gesture driven'") },
    HoverItem(title: "Give it a Star", image: UIImage(named: "star")) { print("Tapped 'Give it a star'") }
]

// Create an HoverView with the previous configuration & items
let hoverView = HoverView(with: configuration, items: items)

// Add to the top of the view hierarchy
view.addSubview(hoverView)
hoverView.translatesAutoresizingMaskIntoConstraints = false

// Apply Constraints
// Never constrain to the safe area as Hover takes care of that
NSLayoutConstraint.activate(
    [
        hoverView.topAnchor.constraint(equalTo: view.topAnchor),
        hoverView.bottomAnchor.constraint(equalTo: view.bottomAnchor),
        hoverView.leadingAnchor.constraint(equalTo: view.leadingAnchor),
        hoverView.trailingAnchor.constraint(equalTo: view.trailingAnchor)
    ]
)
```

For more details about all the parameters that you can configure, take a look into [`HoverConfiguration.swift`](https://github.com/pedrommcarrasco/Hover/blob/master/Hover/Model/HoverConfiguration.swift).

# ‚ù§Ô∏è Support Hover 

Hello there üëã

I‚Äôm Pedro, a Portuguese iOS Engineer since February 2017. I‚Äôm an avid OSS enthusiast and contributor - help by sharing, learn by what‚Äôs shared.

I've built and open-sourced multiple frameworks and applications, including **[Brooklyn](https://github.com/pedrommcarrasco/Brooklyn)** and **[CocoaHub](https://cocoahub.app)**.

I'm also a conference and meetup organizer, being part of **[SwiftAveiro](https://swiftaveiro.xyz)** and **[CocoaHeads Porto](https://www.meetup.com/CocoaHeads-Porto/)**.

If you enjoy my work and would like to help me continue it, please consider:

# üôå Contributing
Feel free to contribute to this project by [reporting bugs](https://github.com/pedrommcarrasco/Hover/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+sort%3Aupdated-desc) or open [pull requests](https://github.com/pedrommcarrasco/Hover/pulls?q=is%3Apr+is%3Aopen+sort%3Aupdated-desc).

Hover was created for personal use but dynamic enough to be an open-source framework. As such, while functional, it may lack some additional customization. If there's something missing that you need, feel free to ask me here or on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/pedrommcarrasco).
